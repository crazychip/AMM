# Awesome Media Machine

### 1.0 What is AMM?

AMM is the Awesome Media Machine.
For the lack of better words: It's a "thingy" that looks for .swf files in
a folder and randomly selects on of them. Why? Well just because, thats
why. Me and my friend like flash loops. Many moons ago he bought a
domain that he really had no particular use for, he just really wanted
it. Some moons later we got the idea to use the domain for flash loops.
He had collected flash loops for a time and we thought it would be cool
to have a site that could show us random flashes. So since I knew a
little PHP I sat down and made the code while he made an index file with
CSS and all that stuff. Soon we had a reasonably okay site the provided
basic "F5 entertainment". 

Soon after this we added stats to the site to count how many times a
file had been selected. This also gave us the possibility to notice if
anyone else enjoyed our "F5 entertainment". Later more features was added
to the site, all more or less useful.

Now the original domain is long dead but the AMM lives on at my domain.
So check out [fezt.lulz.no](http://fezt.lulz.no) for a copy of how the
original site was.
